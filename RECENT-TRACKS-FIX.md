# Recent Tracks Fix - Deployment Instructions

This document explains the changes made to fix the "Unexpected token '<'" error in the Recent Tracks section of the website.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Improved Error Handling in `recent-tracks.js`**:
   - Added explicit JSON Content-Type header
   - Added more detailed logging
   - Enhanced error handling to ensure valid JSON responses, even in error cases
   - Added more robust data validation and fallbacks

2. **Updated SpotifyDisplay.jsx**:
   - Added improved validation for track data
   - Added better error handling with fallback UI elements

3. **Enhanced App.jsx Error Handling**:
   - Added explicit HTML detection to prevent JSON parsing errors
   - Ensured state is always set to a valid value, even on errors

4. **Added Diagnostic Tools**:
   - Added `recent-tracks-test.html` for direct API testing
   - Added diagnostic logging throughout

## Deployment Instructions

1. Make sure all changes are committed to your Git repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Unexpected token error in Recent Tracks"
   ```

2. Deploy to Netlify:
   - If using manual deployment:
     ```
     netlify deploy --prod
     ```
   - If using automatic deployment:
     ```
     git push
     ```

3. After deployment, verify the fix by:
   - Visiting your Netlify site and checking the Recent Tracks section
   - Using the "Test Recent Tracks API" link to validate API responses
   - Checking Netlify function logs for any remaining errors

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists after deployment:

1. Verify your environment variables in the Netlify dashboard:
   - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
   - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
   - SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN

2. Check the Netlify function logs for any errors.

3. Use the test tools to check the API responses and validate that they're returning proper JSON.

4. If HTML is still being returned, there may be an issue with your Spotify credentials or permissions.

## Technical Explanation

The "Unexpected token '<'" error occurs when the frontend JavaScript tries to parse HTML as JSON. This happens when:

1. The Netlify function fails and returns an HTML error page instead of JSON
2. The frontend tries to parse this HTML as JSON, causing a syntax error at the first '<' character

Our fix ensures that even in error cases, the API returns valid JSON (usually an empty array), which prevents the parsing error in the frontend. We've also added extensive validation and error handling throughout the codebase to provide better error messages and fallbacks.
